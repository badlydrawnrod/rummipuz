# Rummipuz

A local Rummikub-style puzzle game for PC and tablet. The current foundation opens a sample board and rack, shows all four difficulty descriptions, and provides the rules. Tile movement, checking, generation, and progress saving are still planned; this is not yet a playable game.

## Run on a PC

Python 3 is the only launch dependency. From this project directory:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory app
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in a modern browser, then select **Open sample puzzle**. On systems where Python is named `python` or `py`, substitute that command for `python3`. Stop the server with Ctrl+C. If the port is occupied, use another port in both the command and URL.

Use the HTTP server rather than opening `index.html` as a file: native JavaScript modules and the sample JSON are loaded over HTTP. There is no build step, package manager, application server, or external asset request.

## Open on a tablet over your local network

1. Connect the PC and tablet to the same local network.
2. Start the server from the project directory with:

   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 0.0.0.0 --directory app
   ```

3. Find the PC's local IPv4 address in its network settings, for example `192.168.1.25`.
4. On the tablet, open `http://192.168.1.25:8000`, substituting the actual PC address. Keep the PC awake and the server running. If needed, permit incoming TCP port 8000 on the PC's private-network firewall; guest Wi-Fi/client isolation can prevent device-to-device access.
5. Open the sample, expand **How to play**, and check portrait and landscape. Longer board rows scroll horizontally without shrinking the tiles.

The `--directory app` option serves only the public app files, rather than repository metadata and configuration. Local HTTP is sufficient for this preview. PWA installation and offline support are not implemented yet; tablet PWA use will require HTTPS, as described in the implementation plan.

## Project layout

- `app/index.html`, `styles.css`, `main.js`, and `tiles.js`: buildless static app and native browser modules.
- `app/puzzles/sample.json`: public runtime copy of `plans/sample-puzzle.json`; keep these files identical when updating the fixture.
- `plans/`: rules, data format, player flow, difficulty policy, and the implementation checklist.

Follow [the implementation plan](plans/rummipuz-implementation.md) for the next step.
